### Project Summary
In this project we plan to implement a concurrent lock-free queue using CAS. We will evaluate the performance of our lock-free implementation by comparing it with a locked queue, which we will also implement.  

##### Possible evaluations
- We can compare the performance improvement of lock-free queue vs the performance improvement of a lock-free stack (which is discussed in class)
